# 🌱 **AI-Powered Personal Farming Assistant**

## 📌 **Project Overview**

The AI-Powered Personal Farming Assistant is a web-based application designed to help farmers and gardeners make smart, data-driven agricultural decisions. The platform uses Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to provide solutions such as plant disease detection, soil analysis, seed identification, weather alerts, and farming schedule reminders — all in one place.

---

## 🎯 **Problem Statement**

Farmers often face challenges such as crop diseases, incorrect crop selection, unpredictable weather, and lack of timely expert guidance. Existing solutions are fragmented, generic, and not personalized. This project aims to reduce guesswork and crop loss by providing instant, personalized, and AI-driven farming assistance.

## 💡 **Proposed Solution**

This system provides:

* Leaf disease detection using plant leaf images
* Soil test result analysis to recommend suitable crops
* Seed image identification
* Garden plant care guidance
* Local weather forecasting with early disaster alerts
* Reminder system for fertilizer and pesticide schedules

---

## 🧩 **Features**

### 🌿 **Leaf Disease Detection**

Upload a leaf image to identify diseases and get chemical and organic treatment suggestions.

### 🌱 **Soil Result Analyzer**

Upload soil test reports to get crop recommendations and soil improvement tips.

### 🌾 **Seed Name Detection**

Identify seeds from images and get cultivation details.

### 🌸 **Garden Plant Care**

Enter the plant name to receive planting, watering, sunlight, and manure guidance.

### ☁️ **Weather Forecast & Alerts**

View local weather conditions and receive early alerts for floods or cyclones.

### ⏰ **Smart Reminders**

Get notified about fertilizer and pesticide application schedules.
